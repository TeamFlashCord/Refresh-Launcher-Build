If you're on Windows, you should probably use the [current one instead](https://github.com/TeamFlashCord/RefreshLauncherBuilds/releases/latest).

# Refresh-Launcher-Build
Builds for the Angry Birds Refresh launcher. This launcher is based off [NewCP's app](https://github.com/New-Club-Penguin/NewCP-App).
